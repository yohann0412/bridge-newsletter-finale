                <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">As future global citizens, the Global Citizenship module is one of the most important to the IB diploma programme students. It helps shape our thinking to adapt and adjust to the world. The teachers, Ms. Divya, Ms. Rumana, Mr.Sheldon and Mr.Charles share so many new things with us and so far the module has been rich in content and highly informative. Last week we gathered in the quiet IB lounge and our senior, Ayan Sule led the class on the topic ‘Human Rights’. We spent the first half of the class researching and discussing what our definition of human rights was and what according to us were the most vital and important rights. The class was then divided into groups and we were given 5 minutes to answer a few questions.

                <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">
                    Towards the end of the class after several group discussions we had one last activity - we were again divided into 3 groups and each group was presented with a scenario representing a global issue currently prevalent in the world such as the ongoing Israel-Palestine situation. We had to research and recognize which Human Rights were at stake to potentially find a solution and then present it in front of everyone. The session was full of healthy debates, friendly competition and lots of constructive criticism.
