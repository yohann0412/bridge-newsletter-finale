                <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">Data Analysis not only teaches us key concepts that will be required for the IBDP program but also looks at the world through a mathematician’s eyes! And guess what! It helped us find math integrated in every little thing we did! </p>
                <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">This week, we covered Correlations, the basics of Statistics. We learnt about strong, moderate and weak correlation, line of best fit and computation of simple correlation through Karl Pearson’s Coefficient of Correlation (we were as intrigued by the name as you are!). We also drew scatter plots, a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data.

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">Once we were clear with the concepts, we moved on to the fun part - word problems! We focused on translating our learning into our lives and vice versa. Whether it was through height-age tables or customer-distance comparisons, we converted real world problems into tables, data and statistics.</p>
                <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">Here’s a fun fact -  if you pick any two random variables or bivariate data, they will necessarily correlate or share a statistical relationship in some way, causal or not!
